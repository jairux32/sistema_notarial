# SANETWAIN Configuration File
#

# Forces the backend to use a different version of TWAINDSM.  The default behavior
# is to use the latest version (the undecorated libtwaindsm.so should always be
# linked to this).  Unfortunately, the TWAIN Working Group had to break with
# backwards compabability for TW_INT32 and TW_UINT32, which were defined as "long"
# making them 64-bit types on 64-bit machines.  These have been fixed to be "int"
# which is 32-bit on all supported platforms.  The problem impacts apps, the DSM,
# and drivers, which must all be agreement as to the size of these data types.
# We can guarantee that sanetwain and the driver will be the same for a given
# release, but we can't control the DSM.  So the fix is to add this override.
# The code will try to make the correct choice based on the sizeof(TW_UINT32), but
# if that doesn't work you'll have to make the fix here.
#option ForceTwainDsm /usr/local/lib/libtwaindsm.so.2.3.1

# Forces the backend to return a path safe device name
#option ForceSafeName

# Forces the backend to ONLY allow for fixed(manual) cropping. With this option
# uncommented the backend will completely disable automatic document detection
# and rotation. It will be up to the user/application to pick the
# correct document size
#option ForceFixedCropping

# Forces the backend to do a scan to find out the image information in case 
# sane_get_parameters is called before scanning begins. This option is
# useful if the application wants to use the results of sane_get_parameters
# to get the size of the image before starting a scan session (via sane_start)
# since these scanners generally automatically detect and rotate the documents
# as they scanned and will also automatically crop to the length of the document
# even in fixed(manual) cropping mode. FOR MOST APPLICATIONS THIS IS *NOT* REQUIRED
#option ForcePrescan

# Forces the backend to add a 1/10 inch (2.54 mm) black border around the document. This
# is useful for applications that do their own autocrop & deskew.
#option ForceAddBorder

# If the SANE application crashes or hangs during closing, then add its name
# to this option.  (ex: option ForceCancelCloses scanadf scanimage)
#option ForceCancelCloses

# If the SANE application crashes during startup and the log indicates that it
# was working on sane_get_devices, then add the name of the application to this
# option.  (ex: option ForceSkipOpenusbFini scanadf scanimage)
#option ForceSkipOpenusbFini

# If the SANE application crashes or hangs during scanning when the front
# and rear scan settings are different (Color vs B&W vs Gray), then add its name
# to this option.  (ex: option ForceGetScanParametersFromFirstImage xsane)
#option ForceGetScanParametersFromFirstImage

# Forces the backend to open the device when it discovers it is connected. This
# will force any firmware downloads or other necessary startup processes to 
# happen when the device is discovered. This is for applications that cannot
# wait long enough for firmware downloads and other startup processes when
# the scanner is opened for scanning
#option ForceOpenOnDiscovery

# Forces the maximum width and height reported by the backend to the values
# specified. These values are in millimeters (mm) and must be integer values.
# These options are made available for applications that don't allow their
# page size to be changed. When selecting a value large than the scanner
# supports, the scanner will silently change the value to it's actual maximum
# ex. option ForceMaxPageWidth 230
#option ForceMaxPageWidth 0
#option ForceMaxPageHeight 0

# Force the backend to ignore sane_cancel if there are more pages left in the
# batch to finish scanning. This is typically NOT necessary.
#option ForceIgnoreCancelDuringBatch

# Force the scanner to wait and scan only after the application ask for an image.
# This will slow down scanning. When it is not set, the driver default is used.
# The valid values are:
#         true         scanner waits for application         (CAP_AUTOSCAN=false)
#         false        scanner does not wait for application (CAP_AUTOSCAN=true)
# This is typically NOT necessary.
#option ForcePaperOnDemand true

# Enables debug logging to /var/kodak/kds_s2000w/sanetwain/sanetwain_#.log
# and enables logging in certain TWAIN backends with the specified debugging level using the
# format "option Debug DebugLevel", ex. option Debug 1
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS OPTION UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO DO SO BY SERVICE AND SUPPORT
#option Debug 1

# Dump images to /var/kodak/kds_s2000w/sanetwain/sanetwain_#.log_images/
# Debug should be set to 1, when using this option.  A value of 1 causes the image files to
# be flushed to disk, any other non-zero value disables the flush
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS OPTION UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO DO SO BY SERVICE AND SUPPORT
#option DumpImages 1

# Replay images from /var/kodak/kds_s2000w/sanetwain/replayimages
# The scan session must be set up to the same settings used for the images that will be
# replayed.  The same batch should be rescanned, but the scanned images will be discarded
# and the replay images will be returned to the application.  This is not a simulator,
# you must have a physical scanner to use this feature.
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS OPTION UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO DO SO BY SERVICE AND SUPPORT
#option ReplayImages 1

# Send an Sane status of EOF when returning last image chunk transfer
#option EOFLastXfer 1

# Lock the scanner from MSG_OPENDS to MSG_CLOSEDS, set to 0 to turn it off
#option BlockLock 1

# 
# Supported Devices List
#
#   The following list specifies the USB VID/PID combinations that are supported
#   by this backend. It follows a format specific to the backend since the standard
#   SANE configuration usb options are not sufficient. The SANE backend will
#   NOT try to load any backends that are not in this list
#
#   The following format is used:
#       USB/VID_vvvv&PID_pppp "TWAIN Product Name"
#
# WARNING! DO NOT EDIT THE FOLLOWING LINES. IT CAN CAUSE YOUR SCANNER TO STOP
# BEING RECOGNIZED BY THE BACKEND
#
USB\VID_29cc&PID_101B "KODAK Scanner: S2000w"
USB\VID_29cc&PID_101C "KODAK Scanner: S2000w"
